## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- VS Code or any code editor
- Live Server extension (recommended)

### Installation & Running

1. **Clone or download the project**
2. **Open in VS Code**
3. **Install Live Server extension** (if not already installed)
4. **Right-click on `index.html`** and select "Open with Live Server"
5. **Or simply open `index.html`** in your browser

### Alternative: Direct Browser Opening
- Double-click `index.html` to open directly in your default browser
- Note: Some features may be limited without a local server

## 🎯 How to Use

### Adding Tasks
1. Type your task in the input field
2. Press Enter or click the "+" button
3. Task will be added to the top of the list

### Managing Tasks
- **Complete**: Click the checkbox next to any task
- **Edit**: Click the edit icon (pencil) to modify task text
- **Delete**: Click the trash icon to remove a task

### Filtering Tasks
- **All**: Shows all tasks (default)
- **Pending**: Shows only incomplete tasks
- **Completed**: Shows only completed tasks

### Bulk Actions
- **Clear Completed**: Removes all completed tasks
- **Clear All**: Removes all tasks (with confirmation)

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Class-Based Architecture
```javascript
class TodoApp {
    constructor() {
        // Initialize app state
    }
    
    // Methods for different functionalities
    addTask() { /* ... */ }
    toggleTask() { /* ... */ }
    deleteTask() { /* ... */ }
    // ... more methods
}
```

### Data Structure
```javascript
const task = {
    id: "unique_id",
    text: "Task description",
    completed: false,
    createdAt: "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z"
}
```

### Local Storage Integration
